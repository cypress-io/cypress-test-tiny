    "Description": "<p>The Brown Advisory Ethical Selection portfolio leverages Brown Advisoryâ€™s long history of both equity and ethical investing.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The portfolio invests in 30-40 U.S stocks, whilst maintaining a strong focus on the ethical standards of the underlying businesses. \r\n<br>\r\n<p>When identifying opportunities, the starting point is to exclude companies that do not meet strict ethical, socially responsible and governance (ESG) standards. This includes companies that:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Breach UN Global Compact Principles </li>\r\n<li>Generate any (i.e. greater than 0%) revenue from conventional weapons </li>\r\n<li>Have direct interest in fossil fuels (owns reserves, generates power from or takes any part in oil and gas production)</li>\r\n<li>Generate more than 5% revenue from either alcohol products, tobacco products, gambling products, weapons and firearms or adult entertainment services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<p> The portfolio goes above and beyond \"negative screening\", that is to simply remove companies that do not meet ESG criteria, by including rigorous ESG analysis on each company considered for investment. The team combines this analysis with their proven active portfolio management capabilities to deliver a best-in-class core, Ethical Selection strategy to investors.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The performance objective is to deliver market beating returns, above the Russell 300 index, by purchasing companies trading at attractive prices, while not sacrificing performance by having an ethical focus. <p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Portfolio rebalancing is ad hoc and not expected to be frequent, given the long term focus.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>For a USD 30,000 portfolio, after transaction costs (0.06% or 2 USD minimum per trade) the total expected cost of the portfolio is 0.99%, or USD 297 per year. For a USD 150,000 portfolio, your total expected cost is 0.80%, or USD 1203 per year.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p> The performance figures provided below are after all costs.<p>",
