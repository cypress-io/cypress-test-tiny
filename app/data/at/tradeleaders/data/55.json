    "Description": "<p>Based on recommendations from Nasdaq’s investment management arm, Nasdaq Dorsey Wright (NDW), our Nasdaq DW Global Momentum portfolio invests into stocks across developed and emerging countries but excluding US companies.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Given its exposure to emerging markets, this portfolio is suited for investors looking to accept high levels of risk with the goal of capturing some of the more aggressive opportunities in stock markets and to beat its benchmark, the Nasdaq Global ex US index.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>For over 20 years the team at NDW have been enhancing their investment process called “Relative Strength”. Specifically, this means ranking stocks based on their price movement and buying those which are in a period of enjoying stronger returns, above the market average. <p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The stocks held in your portfolio are adjusted approximately once a month, depending on market movement and the attractiveness of other stocks. This is all done for you, watch it take place from your account.<p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>For an investment of USD 30,000, after transaction costs (0.06% or 2 USD minimum) the total expected cost of the portfolio is 1.55%, or USD 465 per year. For an investment of USD 150,000, after transaction costs the total expected cost is 0.9%, or USD 1650 per year. <p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The performance figures provided below are after all costs.<p>",
