## Important

Note that this project **DOES NOT** include Cypress dependency in the [package.json](package.json). The reason for such omission is that we use this project to test every Cypress build and do not want to spend time installing `cypress@x.x.x` just to immediately install and test `cypress@y.y.y`. Which means when submitting pull requests with a bug report, please save the problematic version of Cypress in `package.json`. Simply run `npm install --save-dev cypress` or `npm i -D cypress@x.x.x` and commit the change before submitting a pull request.
